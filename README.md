A react project done to practice redux toolkit concepts.

It's a simple todo list app built by React and Redux Toolkit. You can;

- Add a new todo
- Delete a todo
- Update todo status ( toggle between completed to uncompleted)
- See how many uncompleted todos left
- Filter todos by their active and completed status
- Clear all the completed todos with a button
